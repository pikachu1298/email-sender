# email-sender
this is my email sender, download straight from the repo, no releases.
nah i change my mind cuzi am updating to comply with Google Standards sayng that they are removing the Allow less secure app access which will annihlate the Google functionality for authenticating with GMAIL. There will be the old release in the releases and the new release along with the checksums. The exe's may show up as a virus because i am a beginner for coding. just compare the checksums.
# Checksums:
CRC32: D274B473

CRC64: 61FA2F9C44535276

SHA256: 4aeb23ed3c5e7d9dd046f14e2bc498f680694bd75c861c92d38e6b70ba4bcfd3

SHA1: 769d662fc3a9a9f66b620c525f444192c082c6b0

BLAKE2sp: 7bb71390636cf9bd4bfdc8daf7120b59b81d430c107ba09eec820b2473c45cbc
These checksums are for 2.2.2.4
For new ones,
First of all there would be a checksum list in description.txt for all new releases starting from the latest one which will be 3.2.0.5
*bad, crappy versioning ensues*

# IMPORTANT
 Always calculate checksums before using this software. If you download this from any other websites, and the checksums don't match, DELETE THE FILE IMMEDIATELY. IF THE FILE IS MODIFIED, AND THE CHECKSUMS DO NOT MATCH THESE CHECKSUMS. IT IS A VIRUS AND SOMEONE CRACKED IT.
 Remember, this software will NEVER come in a zip file OR have a password like "pikachu", 123, 123456, example.com.
 Always a exe.

# Why do you want my password when I use this software?

We don't. The password is never stored, it connects to smtp.office365.com, and smtp.gmail.com (with TLS).
If you think I'm trying to steal your password, COMPARE THE CHECKSUMS.
The password is for authentication with the email servers. Basically like you logging in with your username and password.

# How do I compare/check the checksums?

You first download 7-Zip. Then you left click the exe, then right click to open the option menu. Then, hover over the CRC SHA menu, then click * . Now you need to copy the checksums and put it in a temporary document. Then, put the checksums listed here into the temporary document. Carefully look at and see if your calculated checksums match the ones listed here. If it doesn't, go to IMPORTANT paragraph above the one above this one. 

# Why did you make this?

Because I was bored.

# How do I use this software?
The software will guide you throwghout the usage.

# Changelogs and updates
# 06/17/2022
I have decided to stop using Microsoft Graph SDK and instead use Java EE mail library due to me being incompetent, not enough time, and me struggling with this stupid little line here: https://imgur.com/a/82LD6TI
*sigh* i will work my best to get v3 out.
